Project Name: Electromagnetic Train
Description: Building a levitating electromagnetic train using coils, a cart with a permanent magnet, a high wattage power supply and, hall effect sensors and high power transistors based on Tom Stanton's "Electromagnetic Rail Launcher" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TGb3MsSjE&ab_channel=TomStanton)

Progress Overview
Total Cost: 2000 EGP
Total Time Spent: 20 hours
Estimated Time Remaining: 80 hours

‚úÖ Completed Tasks:

 Got the Hall effect sensors
 Got the permanent magnets
 Figured out coil wire thickness (0.8 mm on Tom Stanton's video)
 Figured out to add ferromagnetic material inside the coil to increase magnetic field strength
 To mount the coils to the rails use the bolts and nuts
‚è≥ To-Do Tasks:

 Tom Stanton used 2x T slot aluminum bars stacked on top of one another (https://store.fut-electronics.com/collections/openbuilds/products/v-slot-20mm-x-40mm-linear-rail-1m-black-anodized)
