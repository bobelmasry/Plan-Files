Total Time Spent: 100-150 hours
Estimated Time Remaining: 90-140 hours
Tasks
‚úÖ Completed Tasks:

 Decided to use two drone motors for propulsion
 Chosen lightweight PLA as the primary material
 Planned to use two servos for control surfaces (flaps)
 Decided on LTE-based control and navigation, leveraging existing infrastructure
Will use a gyro and GPS for stability and positioning
