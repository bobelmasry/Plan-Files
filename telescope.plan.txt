Tasks
‚úÖ Completed Tasks:

 Decided on a Dobsonian telescope for the best price-to-quality ratio
 Chosen to build the telescope body out of wood
 Found locally available lenses for ~5,000 EGP (https://www.cezma.com/products/ATN/215658/Telescope-Newtonian-Mirror-Diameter-76mm-F.L-900mm)
Note: Mirror may be spherical instead of parabolic, which could require additional polishing
 Eyepiece will be salvaged from a National Geographic telescope
 Calculated potential magnification:
Mirror focal length: 1300 mm
Eyepiece focal length: 10 mm
Magnification: 130x (Enough to see Jupiter, Saturn, Mars, and possibly other planets)
‚è≥ To-Do Tasks:

 Buy lenses
 Determine if the mirror is parabolic or spherical; if spherical, figure out how to make it parabolic
 Buy wood and build the frame for the telescope
