✅ Completed Tasks:

 Increased servo frequency (time.sleep) from 0.05 to 0.5 to prevent stopping due to a steep voltage drop
Alternatively: Use a motor controller and use the Raspberry Pi only for PWM

 Build a platform to be glued to the servo
 Buy a camera, glue it on the platform, and use it instead of my phone
 Add a button with an LED indicator to show whether it's recording or not
 (Optional) Add a tiny display
